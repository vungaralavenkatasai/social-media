# social-media
Social media is any digital technology that allows users to instantly generate and share information with the public. Social media includes a wide variety of websites and apps. Some, such as Twitter, are focused on sharing links and brief written messages. Others, like Instagram, are designed to facilitate sharing of photographs and videos.
What distinguishes social media is that it is simultaneously vast and somewhat uninhibited. While many social media businesses place certain restrictions, such as removing photographs that depict violence or nudity, there are far fewer restrictions on what people can post than on traditional forms of mass communication, such as magazines, radio stations, and tv. 
Anyone with an internet connection can make a social media profile. They can use that profile to post any content they like, and whatever they share is visible to anybody who views their page or account. The capacity to instantly post photographs, views, and events has changed the way people live and do business.
